# -Purchase-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on various personal and behavioral attributes. The dataset used for this analysis is a synthetic Purchase Info Dataset that contains features such as CustomerID, Age, Gender, PurchaseAmount, ProductCategory, and the target yes no.
# 🛍️ Purchase Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a customer will make a purchase based on their age, gender, purchase amount, and product category.

## 📂 Dataset
A synthetic dataset named `purchase_data.csv` is used with the following columns:
- `CustomerID`
